# IndiaCodex Hackathon 2025 - Cardano Hardware Implementation with Plant Monitoring

This project demonstrates a revolutionary integration of blockchain technology with IoT hardware for sustainable agriculture monitoring. Built on the Cardano blockchain (PreProd testnet), our system combines Arduino-based sensor networks with real-time transaction verification displays. The hardware implementation features dual Arduino Uno boards: one monitoring environmental conditions (soil moisture, temperature, humidity) through calibrated sensors, and another displaying blockchain transaction confirmations via I2C LCD interface. The system bridges physical plant health data with immutable blockchain records, creating a transparent and verifiable supply chain for agricultural produce. Key components include automated payment triggers based on sensor thresholds, real-time LCD transaction display with heartbeat monitoring, integration with Cardano's address management and UTXO model, and a comprehensive bridge system connecting hardware sensors to blockchain infrastructure. This solution addresses critical challenges in agricultural transparency, enables micro-payments for sustainable farming practices, provides immutable records of growing conditions, and demonstrates practical blockchain applications beyond traditional finance.
